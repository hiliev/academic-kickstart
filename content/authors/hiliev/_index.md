Hi there! My name is Hristo and I'm what you get when you combine a theoretical physicist and a software developer.
I'm the chief data scientist of [holler.live](https://business.holler.live) and most of my time goes in writing Python and Scala code, scraping and analysing data, designing algorithms, and learning about information retrieval in general.
You can also find me answering questions on Stack Overflow. I seem to have become something of an authority on parallel programming there, and in particular am the only one as of today (February 2020) to hold golden badges for both MPI and OpenMP.

In my free time, I like to reverse engineer stuff - it fascinates me to understand how things work and I learn so many things.
I've also done research in physics and performance optimisation of serial and parallel engineering and scientific codes.
